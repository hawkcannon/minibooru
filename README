This is a (rather crude) booru written in Python with Django. It's mostly meant for use by individuals
and not public servers, so there are a lot of features missing that would be necessary for multi-user systems
(muliple accounts, removing posts, etc.). That said, it's mostly usable now.

To launch the server, run launch_server.bat, or type ``python manage.py runserver'' in console.

If you delete the database or change the database's structure, type ``python manage.py syncdb'' in console.
